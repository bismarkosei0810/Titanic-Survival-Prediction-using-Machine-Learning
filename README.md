# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Concise, well-commented notebook that predicts Titanic survival with Logistic Regression (79 % accuracy). 4 features, full EDA to evaluation in one file. This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using historical passenger data. 
he goal is to demonstrate a clear, end-to-end machine learning workflow, from data exploration to model evaluation.

# Dataset
The dataset comes from the well-known Kaggle Titanic dataset and contains information about passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare.

Files used:

train.csv – training data with survival labels

test.csv – test data without survival labels

## Methodology
The project follows these steps:
### 1. Data Exploration
Survival distribution analysis

Visualizations by gender,

class,

age, 

and fare
### 2. Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

### 3. Feature scaling
Model Training
Random Forest Classifier
Train–test split for fair evaluation
### 4. Model Evaluation
Accuracy score
Classification report
Confusion matrix
Feature importance analysis
Model Performance
The Random Forest model achieves strong predictive performance using only four features.
Sex and Passenger Class are the most important predictors of survival.
The results reflect historical realities such as the “women and children first” evacuation policy.
